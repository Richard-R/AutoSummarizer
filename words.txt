Part 1: Understanding


	Brad Evans and Sean Wilson, focus on Paulo Freire as the founder of critical pedagogy, a protest to traditional education that focuses on being aware of oppression and constantly challenging people’s beliefs and practices. 

Henry A Giroux, taking Freire’s ideas even further, illuminated the war going on right now waged against universities and students, the "destruction of critical awareness" (Evans, 56) through oppression from people on the top of social and economic ladders. Critical pedagogy, independent of militarism and corporate interests, is the only way to effectively participate in the transformation of the world. 




Paulo Freire writes about dehumanization, a "distortion of the vocation of becoming more fully human" (Freire, no page numbers) as not a set human historical reality but a transformable state. It is only through the struggle of the oppressed and praxis that they can regain their humanity, because oppressors cannot see past their own power distortions and "false generosity". Ultimately, the oppressed must avoid the duality of "fear of freedom" find true value in an authentic living, setting aside the consciousness of their subjugators.
